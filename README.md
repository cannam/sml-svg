A writer for SVG files written in Standard ML
---------------------------------------------

https://hg.sr.ht/~cannam/sml-svg

This is a library for writing a subset of SVG vector graphics files
from a Standard ML program. Does not (yet?) provide any other features
apart from defining an SVG structure and serialising it.

Requires `sml-stringinterpolate`.
